    Just getting started, and I'm starting to see how much work 
    truly goes into developing an application, and how much is
    abstracted. It's a bit overwhelming and frustrating. I'm trying
    to balance AI use, and my own understanding of things... hopefully
    future apps go smoother without as many questions.

    Small features I took for granted, take a lot more work than 
    expected. 

    -mainwindow added   
        -textbox + checklist conversion of text functions
